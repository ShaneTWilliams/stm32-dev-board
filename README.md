# stm32-dev-board
### ***A small-footprint, custom development PCB for the STM32 platform***

* This board's MCU is an STM32F072CBT6, meaning it is a higher-end 48-pin LQFP chip with 128kB of flash and an ARM Cortex-M0 core.

* The board supports CANbus, LINbus, I<sup>2</sup>C, SPI, USB,  and UART. Flashing can be achieved through an ST-LINK external flasher using the SWD protocol.

* The board is powered through a Micro-USB port and draws very little current. Power conversion occurs through a 5~3.3V linear regulator.

* The board has a 32.768kHz clock for RTC capabilities as well as an 8MHz system clock. It also features an indicator LED and a reset button.

* The footprint of the board is 19x52 mm and its 2.54 mm pitch headers allow it to be used with standard breadboards.
